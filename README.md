How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are a lot of different ways to ensure that my code, programs, and software are functional and secure. One example would be unit testing. Unit testing is very important to any program without it the code could malfunction and accept wrong inputs or allow access to unauthorized individuals. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is essential to a successful program. To interpret user needs, a programmer or tester needs to review the software requirements for the program. My approach to designing software is to thoroughly read through the requirements. This way I can know what the client wants and start to understand what it is they intended it to do.


How do I approach designing software?

For my approach to designing software, I like to begin by coming up with a rough idea of the program and then try to work on the program in sections. For me, it is easier to work on a section of code, and then run that section to make sure it functions the way I intended. As an example, I struggled with this course, so I tried to write a section of code, and then write a section of tests for that section. This way I could make sure I did not forget anything.
